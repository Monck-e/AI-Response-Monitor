# AI-Response-Monitor
Monitor response completion and make notification.


It is a tampermonkey plugin, so it obviously requires Tampermonkey.


When you use it for the first time, the website may ask whether you allow it to send notifications. You should click the "Allow" button to make AI Monitor available to send notifications.

It can automatically monitor whether you send a message, and it will change the prompter dot from green to yellow. When the answer is completed, it will send you both a website notification and a system notification, whether you are on the page or not. 

That means you can do other things while the AI is generating an answer, making better use of your time and working more efficiently.


AI Monitor now could be used on :
